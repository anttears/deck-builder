# Deck builder
Build a deck of cards from a selection of Magic The Gathering sets.
The sets can be added from the card-set sister site, which allows updates to the mongoDb that servers the data.
So card-set is a node - express- mongoose site which provides the API for this site.
Deck builder uses React, Redux and Chakra to provide the functionality.

### Next steps
I'll allow some manipulation of the data structure, so the cards aren't always displayed by colour type, but perhaps by subtype, so you'd get instants, socery, create etc.
If the data format stays the same, then the views won't have to change to display the different data style.
Also, need to support artifacts properly.
Also, add side decks and saving of the data.
It would be amazing to get the images and make proper cards, but I think that's unlikely.


### Full Disclosure
Very early stages of development and I'm not realistically expecting anyone else to ever use or care about this.
